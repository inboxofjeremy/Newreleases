    "description": "Stitch Head was the first creature brought to 'almost life' by mad professor Erasmus. In the years since, he’s become nursemaid to the master’s ever-growing menagerie of neglected creatures, tasked with teaching them to suppress their 'inner monster' and hide out in the castle — away from prying eyes and itchy pitchfork fingers, of the village mob in the valley below. But when grubby circus impresario Fulbert Freakfinder arrives offering Stitch Head a starring role in his freak show, our hero is tempted by the promise of love and acceptance.",
