    "description": "The Road to WrestleMania begins at Royal Rumble, and the top Superstars in WWE are set to compete for a championship bout at WrestleMania. The matches will begin with two superstars in the ring. At equally timed intervals, a new superstar enters the fray. Elimination only occurs when a superstar has gone over the top rope and both feet have touched the floor. This continues until there is just one superstar left standing as the winner of the Royal Rumble Match. Also, AJ Styles will put his incredible career on the line against Gunther and Drew McIntyre will defend his WWE championship against Sami Zayn.",
