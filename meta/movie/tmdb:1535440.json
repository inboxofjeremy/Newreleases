    "description": "Natalie is a children’s book illustrator struggling with creative burnout that finds unexpected inspiration when she comes across a little girl’s Christmas gift list. Unlike other children’s Christmas lists, Caroline writes her list of heartfelt prayers to Jesus, requesting blessings for her family, friends, and community – including one to ask that her recently widowed dad will find happiness again. Touched by Caroline’s list, Natalie begins to secretly fulfill each blessing. In turn, she is inspired to create a new character, Adeline the Angel, to illustrate the ways Jesus quietly works through everyday people to answer prayers with love and grace.",
